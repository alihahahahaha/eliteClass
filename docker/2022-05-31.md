## Docker

### CI/CD

> Continuous Intergration (CI持续集成)
> Continuous Delivery (CD持续交付)
> Continuous Deployment(CD持续部署)

### overview

- spearate application from infrastructure
- manage infrastructure in the same way manage application, so can diliver software quickly
- shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly

### Container

*package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called container*, containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application

docker provides tooling and a platform to manage the lifecycle of containers

- develop application and it's supporting components using containers.
- the container becomes the unit for distributing and testing application
- deploy application into production environment as a container or an orchestrated service

### docker architecture

- docker daemon

dockerd listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects, a docker daemon also communicate with other daemon to manage Docker services

- docker client

the Docker client (docker) sends commands to dockerd, the Docker command uses the Docker API, the Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon

- docker desktop

- docker registries

a Docker rigistry stores Docker images, Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use, and Docker is configured to look for iamges on Docker Hub by default. 

- docker objects
    - images
    - containers
    - networks
    - volumes
    - plugins
    - etc

- Images

an image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container

- Container

a container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI. you can connect a container to one or more networks
