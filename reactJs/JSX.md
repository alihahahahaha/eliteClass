## Separation of concerns(SoC)

A design priciple for separating a computer program into distinct sections. Each section address a separate concern, a set of information that affects the code of a computer program.

A concern can be as general as "the details of the hardware for an application", or as specific as "the name of which class to instantiate".

A program that embodies SoC well is called a modular program
